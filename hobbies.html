        <h2>Dirt Biking:</h2>
        <p style="text-indent: 5%;">I have been riding dirt bikes since I was about 6 years old. My family loves camping in the summer so that is when we ride them. I usually 
            ride on the trails by where I live in the mountains because it is pretty close. We have also made weekend trips to Pipestone to ride there. 
            There are a lot of good trails there and they are pretty well taken care of.

            is located a few miles out of Butte, MT. Here is a photo of my dirt scooter:

        <h2>Playing Guitar:</h2>
            <p style="text-indent: 5%;">I started playing the guitar about 2 years ago. I really like playing it, it makes me mad most of the time though. I started on an acoustic
                guitar but about a year ago I got an electric guitar and I like it a lot more. I play just about every day and I am currently running out of
                songs to learn, so that's great. Yeah.

        <h2>Golfing:</h2>
            <p>I just started golfing this year because my High School got a team. I like it a lot and it's really fun when I shoot well. I got really close to 
                getting a hole in one at a meet in Harlowton at the Jawbone Creek Country Club on a Par 3. The lowest I scored in-season was a 125, but since then I have broken 100 and 
                scored a 97. Below is a goofy picture of me at a golf meet:

        <h2>Snowboarding and Snowmobiling:</h2>
            <p>I love winter sports, they are some of my favorite things to do in the winter. I have been around skiing/snowboarding and snowmobiling my whole life. 
                I skiied for 9 years, starting at age 3; and then I started snowboarding when I was 12 and have been on a board for 6 years now. I like it a lot more and I think it is way more
                fun! I started riding snowmobiles with my family when I was really young. We take trips down to West Yellowstone and Island Park every once in a while to ride for the weekend. 
                It's really cool down there and there's always so much snow!
