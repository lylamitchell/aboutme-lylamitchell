        <h2>Introduction-</h2>
    
        <p>My name is Lyla Mitchell and I am from a really small town in the middle of Montana 
            with a population of 400 people! My hobbies include: camping, riding dirtbikes, traveling, 
            playing the guitar, snowbaording, snowmobiling, listening to music, and golfing. My favorite music artists 
            are: <a href = "https://noahkahan.com" target = "_blank">Noah Kahan</a>, Rainbow Kitten Surprise, <a href = 
            "https://www.thelumineers.com" target = "_blank">The Lumineers</a>, Kings
            of Leon, Dominic Fike, Bon Iver, and Zach Bryan. I have one younger brother and two dogs. I grew up on a ranch and we have 
            a couple mini cows named Tilly and Vayda. This summer I worked at <a href = "https://crumblcookies.com/stores/mt/mtgreatfalls" 
            target = "_blank">Crumbl</a> in Great Falls and it was a pretty fun
            experience. The picture below is a photo taken by me, of me, in the Tetons this summer!</p>

        <h2>What I Hope To Do After Graduating:</h2>

        <p>After graduating from FVCC, I plan on either continuing my education at the University of Montana or finding a job
            in the UX/UI field. When I applied at FVCC I applied to be in the Graphic Design program, but now I am taking classes
            for a Web Tech major. I switched over because I wanted to attain some of the technical aspects of the field because I  
            thought that it would give me some really useful skills.
