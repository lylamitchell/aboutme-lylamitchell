            National Convention Trips:
        </h2>
        <p>
            In high school, I was in a lot of clubs. A few of which I qualified for national competitions in. In BPA (Business Professionals
            of America) I made it to Nationals 2 yaers in a row and they were located in Chicago, IL (2024); and Orlando, FL (2025). They were both
            very fun places to go, but I think that Chicago was my favorite. The event that I qualified in was called Desktop Publishing, where I was 
            given three prompts to create in under 90 minutes. In Chicago I placed 16th in the Nation.

            Close-Up:

        <p>During my Junior and Senior year we fundraised for a trip to New York and Washington DC with a program called <a href="https://www.closeup.org" target="">Close-Up</a>. It was a really 
            good experience to see all of the history and the monuments there.
